<p>I am a musician, composer, and audio engineer based in Perth, Western Australia.</p>
<p><b>Electronic Music</b></p>
<p style="width:95%">I make ambient and experimental electronic music, with a particular interest in process-based composition and semi-generative systems. In 2020 I presented <a href="https://jeremysegal.bandcamp.com/album/four-footprints">Four Footprints</a>, a collection of ambient and environmental pieces, in six-channel surround sound at Callaway Auditorium. In 2021 I released <a href="https://jeremysegal.bandcamp.com/album/plateaux">Plateaux</a>, an EP exploring audible process and transformation via aesthetic elements of ambient, techno, and noise. I am currently working on a collection of multi-channel works exploring algorithmic treatments of the voice, which will be presented at Callaway Auditorium on June 16th at 7pm, as well as a commissioned piece for <a href="https://ae.tonelist.com.au/">Audible Edge</a> 2022, which will be performed at Old Customs House, Fremantle in September.</p>
<p style="width:95%">I have recently performed live electronic sets at WA Museum Boola Bardip, Outcome Unknown, Weekend At Bernie's Festival, The Bird and Tomich House, and with Seacrest Gardens at Fremantle Biennale, Goolugatup Heathcote, and Audible Edge.</p>

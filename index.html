<p><b>Electronic Music</b></p>
<p style="width:95%">I make ambient and experimental electronic music, with a particular interest in process-based composition and semi-generative systems. In 2020 I presented <a href="https://jeremysegal.bandcamp.com/album/four-footprints">Four Footprints</a>, a collection of ambient and environmental pieces, in six-channel surround sound at Callaway Auditorium. In 2021 I released <a href="https://jeremysegal.bandcamp.com/album/plateaux">Plateaux</a>, an EP exploring audible process and transformation via aesthetic elements of ambient, techno, and noise. In 2022 I presented two multi-channel, semi-generative works exploring algorithmic treatments of voiceâ€”a collection of fixed media pieces called Voice Rhythm AM Drone and a text-to-speech based piece commissioned by Tone List for their <a href="https://ae.tonelist.com.au/">Audible Edge</a> festival of sound.</p>
<p style="width:95%">I have recently performed live electronic sets at WA Museum Boola Bardip, Outcome Unknown, Weekend At Bernie's Festival, The Bird and Tomich House, and with Seacrest Gardens at Fremantle Biennale, Goolugatup Heathcote, and Audible Edge.</p>

<p><b>Studio Work</b></p>
<p style="width:95%">I record and mix music in a range of styles and contexts including, but not limited to, indie-rock, synth-pop, folk, ambient, experimental and electronic music. I enjoy working in both studio and non-studio environments (I get a kick out of running sessions in homes/unconventional spaces when its suitable for the project). Whether in the studio or on location I am particularly interested in capturing a sense of space and situation along with the music. I mix music made in a variety of ways, from studio recordings to DIY productions, live performances, and everything inbetween. My rates vary project to project - feel free to <a href="mailto:jeremy.s.segal@gmail.com">
get in touch</a> for an estimate.</p>

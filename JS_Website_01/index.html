<p>I am a musician, composer, and audio engineer based in Perth, Western Australia.</p>
<p><b>Composition and Electronic Music</b></p>
<p>I make ambient and experimental electronic music, with a particular interest in process-based composition and semi-generative systems. In 2020 I presented <a href="https://jeremysegal.bandcamp.com/album/four-footprints">Four Footprints</a>, a collection of ambient and environmental pieces, in six-channel surround sound at Callaway Auditorium. In 2021 I released <a href="https://jeremysegal.bandcamp.com/album/plateaux">Plateaux</a>, an EP exploring audible process and transformation via aesthetic elements of ambient, techno, noise, and serialism. I am currently working on a collection of multi-channel works exploring algorithmic treatments of the voice, which will be presented at Callaway Auditorium on June 16th at 7pm, as well as a commissioned piece for <a href="https://ae.tonelist.com.au/">Audible Edge</a> 2022.
	<p>I have recently performed ambient/electronic sets at WA Museum Boola Bardip, Outcome Unknown, Weekend At Bernie's Festival, The Bird and Tomich House, and with Seacrest Gardens at Fremantle Biennale, Goolugatup Heathcote, and Audible Edge.
<p><b>Bands</b></p>
<p>Segue was an indie-rock band turned synth-pop duo active from 2015 to 2022. We released two EPs and two albums. My personal favourite is our first full length <a href="https://segue.bandcamp.com/album/primary-ties">Primary Ties</a>. We supported touring artists including Cate le Bon, Methyl Ethel, and Deep Sea Arcade.</p>
<p>Didion's Bible is an art-rock band active since 2017. You can check out our music <a href="https://didionsbible.bandcamp.com/">here</a></p>
<p><b>Studio Work</b></p>
<p>I have produced, recorded, and mixed music in a range of styles and contexts, from synth-pop to indie-rock, folk, and live performance. Portfolio coming soon.</p>
